#On Github wikis

##Collaborators

> By default, only collaborators on your repository can make changes to wikis, but you can configure this to be enabled for all users on public repositories.

Q:  is there a way to allow the public to make suggestions/comments ... with or without a github account

##Markup/markdown format 

> Wiki pages can contain any markup that GitHub supports. The default choice is Markdown, but you can use the "Edit mode" drop-down menu to switch to a different markup language.

##Links

> If your pages are rendered with Markdown, the link syntax is [Link Text](URL_to_wiki).
> You can also create links with the wiki format of [[Link Text|WikiLink]]. In this case, WikiLink is the name of your wiki page, not the full URL. 

- DR: the latter should be useful and faster and maybe less likely to cause an error if the hyperlink changes?
