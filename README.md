#On Github wikis

##Collaborators

> By default, only collaborators on your repository can make changes to wikis, but you can configure this to be enabled for all users on public repositories.

Q:  is there a way to allow the public to make suggestions/comments ... with or without a github account

##Markup/markdown format 

> Wiki pages can contain any markup that GitHub supports. The default choice is Markdown, but you can use the "Edit mode" drop-down menu to switch to a different markup language.

##Links

> If your pages are rendered with Markdown, the link syntax is [Link Text](URL_to_wiki).
> You can also create links with the wiki format of [[Link Text|WikiLink]]. In this case, WikiLink is the name of your wiki page, not the full URL. 

- DR: the latter should be useful and faster and maybe less likely to cause an error if the hyperlink changes?

##Editing offline ('cloning')

> If you're using GitHub Desktop, click Clone in Desktop to copy the wiki to your computer. Once you have cloned the wiki, you can add new files, edit existing ones, and commit your changes. You and your collaborators can create branches when working on wikis, but only changes pushed to the master branch will be made live and available to your readers.

#Wish list (for wiki)

1. Automated content bar (ToC for each page)
1. Automate (?) 'reference' section at the bottom of each page (or are these simply 'footnotes'?)
1. 'Template' indexing across articles in the same theme (see bottom of a Wiki page, e.g., [Fundraising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization)
