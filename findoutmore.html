        <p>Millions of employees anticipate end-of-year bonuses, particularly in the financial sector. Before the bonuses are announced many are uncertain whether they will get a bonus, and how large it will be. For example, in 2014-15 UK bonuses <a href = "http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171766_414566.pdf">totalled £42 billion</a>. In the wake of recent financial turmoil these bonuses are coming under increasing public scrutiny as <a href = "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/13/boris-bonuses-homeless">politicians call on bankers</a> to “palliate their guilt” and give their bonuses to charity. While the banking sector is no stranger to charitable giving it can seem that a celebrity’s <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/04/oscars-pizza-delivery-man-1000-tip-ellen-degeneres">$1000 tip</a> will get more public recognition than a <a href = "http://www.today.com/money/jamie-dimon-100m-investment-detroit-isnt-jpmorgan-chase-pr-campaign-2D79695458">$100 million</a> development project. High-profile ‘give if you win’ initiatives may help make the bonus culture more socially acceptable: when bankers succeed, so will charities. This is a win-win situation: bonuses are a ripe target for fundraising, and banks are eager for better press. So how should charities and professional fundraising organisations go about this? </p>
        <p><i>In particular, should they ask bankers in advance to commit a share of ‘their bonus in excess of expectations’ or should they wait and ask until bonuses have been revealed?</i></p>
        <p>There are strong arguments – and significant evidence – that, in certain environments <b>it would be better to ask conditionally, and in advance.</b></p>
        <p>David Reinstein and co-authors have <a href = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91553/Giving_and_Probability.pdf">run several experiments</a> to compare differences in charitable giving between two key environments. Participants had a ½ or ¼ chance of winning a (£5 - £20) prize, and asked to donate under one of two conditions, either,
            <ol>
                <li>asked to <a href = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91553/beforeamazon.png">commit to donate</a> if they won, with the donation automatically deducted from the prize or</li>
                <li>asked to donate after they found out they had won the prize/bonus.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>The results were similar in both a lab experiment and a field experiment involving a student employability promotion:  <i style = "font-weight: bold">Overall, participants committed to donate more in the first condition than in the second condition.</i></p>
        <p>This is consistent with previous behavioural economics work suggesting:
            <ol>
                <li>people quickly adapt to, and are reluctant to part with ‘money in hand’,</li>
                <li>are more generous with less tangible income and wealth, and </li>
                <li>pursue reputation and self-esteem by committing to behave pro-socially in the future.  </li>
            </ol>
