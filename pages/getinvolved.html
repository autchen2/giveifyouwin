                Your organisation will contribute to society through advancing research and
                promoting charitable giving. This is a great means of going beyond the regulatory
                minimum and showing good will in a post-2008 world.

          <p>Fundraisers make specific appeals to employees who anticipate an unknown potential bonus
          being revealed and awarded at a certain time (e.g. 25 December). We will randomly assign employees
          into three groups.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>A1 - </b><i>‘Give from known bonus’</i>:  These employees are asked on 10 January, after they
                know their bonus, to donate a portion of it, to be collected in one week (17 January).</li><br>
              <li><b>A2 - </b><i>‘Give known bonus in 3 months’</i>:  Asked on 10 January, after bonus is learned,
                to donate a portion of it, to be collected in three months.</li><br>
              <li><b>B  - </b><i>‘Give from unknown bonus in 3 months’</i>:  Asked on 10 November (before they know what
                their bonus will be) to pledge a portion of their unanticipated potential bonus, conditionally
                on the size of the bonus, to be collected on 17 January.  Depending on feasibility, (i) the
                committed amount could be directly and automatically deducted from any bonus, or (ii) the employee
                could merely be reminded of their previous commitment after receiving their bonus.</li><br>

                <p>Participating organisations are <b>not</b> expected to contribute directly to fund this pilot.
                  The main source of funding will be an ESRC Impact Acceleration fund.

              <h4 class="faq-subheading">What charity are you fundraising for?</h4>

                </p>
                <br>

              <h4 class="faq-subheading">Will you need access to private employee data?</h4>
                <p>To analyse this properly, we would need only minimally-descriptive data: the group assigned
                   (A1, A2, or B - see example design for an implementation), and the amount donated, from each individual. Any data we would analyse would
                   be stripped of identifying information, and made otherwise unidentifiable.

              <h4 class="faq-subheading">I am interested in trying this, but I don’t want to run a trial. Can you help me?</h4>
                <p>Yes, David Reinstein and the University of Exeter are eager to speak with your organisation
                   about how you can benefit from this research and this idea, whether or not you are willing to
                   pursue an experiment or a controlled trial.

                 <br>

              <h4 class="faq-subheading">Has anything like this been done before?</h4>
                 <p>A range of prominent economists and social scientists have worked with firms, fundraisers, and
                    charitable organisations to investigate and measure ‘what works.’ These have yielded highly
                    interesting and practical results. For example:
                    <ul>
                       <li><a href = "https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/effect-matching-ratios-charitable-giving-united-states" target = "_blank">Dean Karlan and John List</a>
                         worked with a prominent US nonprofit to run an experiment involving a major mail solicitation to over
                         50,000 prior donors. They found that the presence of  a ‘matching grant’ from a third party boosted
                         response rates by about 2% and revenue per solicitation by about $1, but increasing the match rate did not
                         have any additional effect.</li> <br>
                       <li><a href = "http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpimr/research/opera_matching.pdf" target = "_blank">Steffen Huck and Imran Rasul</a>
                         worked with on a postal fundraising campaign sent to 24,000 regular attendees at Bavarian State Opera House.
                         Their result: “if charitable organizations can use lead gifts as they wish, our results show that they
                         maximize donations given by simply announcing the presence of a lead gift.”</li> <br>
                       <li><a href = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272711000764" target = "_blank">Anna Breman</a>
                         worked with two development charities (Diakonia and Save the Children) running a telephone solicitation in
                         Sweden, involving 7710 existing regular donors. Result: Asking donors to increase their donation amounts
                         starting in two months–rather than immediately–led to a 4% higher success rate and £0.50 more raised per
                         month per donor.</li>
                     </ul>

                   <br>

                <h4 class="faq-subheading">What is your experience with this?</h4>
                   <p>Before joining the University of Exeter as a Senior Lecturer in Economics David Reinstein lectured
                      at the University of Essex, where he helped found the ESSExLab and served as Lab Director. He has
                      run laboratory and field experiments in the USA, UK, and Germany, including working with the
                      Behavioural Insights Team, the Brixton Pound, Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust and the HMRC.
                      He has presented this and other research at a variety of venues and conferences, for academic,
                      industry professionals, and policymakers, including the University of Oxford, the EC-JRC Vaccination
                      Workshop,  the ESRC ‘Generosity and Well-Being’ workshop 2013, the Royal Economics Society, at the
                      British Academy ‘Nudge and Beyond’ workshop.

                    <br>

                 <h4 class="faq-subheading">I am interested in trying new fundraising techniques, but not involving bonuses or winnings. What other tools can I use or test?</h4>
                    <p>Recent work supports several innovative approaches and offers avenues to test, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Variations in the social environment, anonymity, and potential for recognition for donors;
                              particularly making individual donations public, by default or by ‘opt-in.</li><br>
                          <li>Offering donors tangible impact, influence, and choice over how their funds are used.</li><br>
                          <li>Optimising the timing of charitable asks (does one appeal crowd out another?).</li>
                        </ul>
